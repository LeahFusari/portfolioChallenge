# portfolioChallenge
This will be my first attempt at creating a web developers portfolio for my Boot Camp Weekly Challenge.  See below for user story and acceptence criteria.


## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
## Acceptence Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Explanation of the page
```
There was no source code given for this Challenge.  Although I did base my design losely on the 'Run Buddy' project from Lesson 2, all of the coding was written my me.

My hero may seem pretty large but I plan to add to that as the project progresses as I assume it will.  For now, please enjoy the view atop Mt. Washington, NH.

The first two project cards are links to the deployed projects and the last two are just placeholders.

You can click on my interest cards to see a the full picture if you like.

The Media Queries were written for:

* max-width 980px
* max-width 760px
* iPhone X 375px x 812px

It should be noted that the "Contact Me" links at the bottom do not show my real phone # or email, as I do not yet fully understand the privacy (or lack thereof) of github, but they do work.
